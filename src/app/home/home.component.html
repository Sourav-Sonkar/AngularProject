        The Postbook app does more than help you stay connected with your friends and interests. It's also your personal
        organizer for storing, saving and sharing photos. It's easy to share photos straight from your Android camera,
        and you have full control over your photos and privacy settings. You can choose when to keep individual photos
        private or even set up a secret photo album to control who sees it.

        favorite celebrities, brands, news sources, artists, or sports teams to follow their newsfeeds, watch live
        streaming videos and be caught up on the latest happenings no matter where you are!
